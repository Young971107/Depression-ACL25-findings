1. I decided to leave my ex-boyfriend after years of contemplating because we were always having disagreements and weren't on the same wavelength.
2. I am currently staying with my friend who just had surgery, and I am enjoying it even though we couldn't live together long term.
3. I am proud of persevering through difficulties and making a commitment to go to school on my own.
4. I regret not focusing more on finding someone to spend my life with, as it becomes harder after turning forty.
5. I am in school right now, working on my general education at SMC, after not finishing school earlier due to health problems.
