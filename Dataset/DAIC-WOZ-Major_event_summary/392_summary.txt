1. I dream of being a writer because I want to write what I am interested in, unlike the articles about teenager culture that I currently write.
2. I would advise my younger self not to go out of my way to impress people, as those who like me will do so regardless.
3. I sometimes feel lazy and wish I had a better work ethic.
4. Last night, I felt really happy while hanging out with my friends, sharing stories, and laughing.
5. My grandmother was a positive influence on me from a young age because of her strong and powerful character.
6. The hardest decision I ever made was deciding whether or not to divorce my husband because we weren't getting along.
7. I am close with my grandparents because they raised me, unlike my parents who weren't really in the picture.
8. When my sister died, it was really traumatizing for me.
9. I feel guilty about not talking to my grandparents as much as I should.
10. I like the weather and people in L.A., but I don't like the traffic.
