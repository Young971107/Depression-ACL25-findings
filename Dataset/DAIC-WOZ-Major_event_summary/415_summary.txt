1. Last Saturday, I felt really happy because I did a weigh-in and lost seven pounds, which was exciting for me.

2. In high school, I was ahead in all my classes and credits, so I took a college course and ended up getting a two-year college degree while still in high school.

3. I used to box, which helped me let out a lot of frustration, and sometimes I still go to the gym for a kickboxing class.

4. My sisters and I have started doing yoga, and we already go to the beach every Friday. Yoga has become our new addiction.

5. I am proud of my job and career because I've come a long way at twenty-three with the job I hold.

6. Moving to L.A. was a significant event for me because I'm really close with my family, and it was hard to transition from them taking care of everything to me and my sisters doing it on our own.

7. Two to three years ago, my brother was shot on duty and almost lost his life. I still think about it often and cry about it like it happened yesterday.

8. Last year, my sisters and I went on a trip to Hawaii, visiting Honolulu and Maui. Jet-skiing in Honolulu was one of my most memorable experiences.
