1. I felt really happy this weekend when I had a great time with friends, engaging in a long, meaningful conversation that lasted for hours. It was refreshing to talk with smart, informed, and open-minded people.

2. I went to school later in life because I wanted to actually know something. It was very difficult, but I did it because I was fascinated and didn't want to be intimidated by it.

3. I moved to L.A. in 2001 to attend UCLA for three years in their screenwriting program.

4. I wish I could erase altercations I've had with my mom from my memory, especially the things I've said to hurt her.

5. I regret not being more productive or efficient in the use of my time each day. I hate wasting time, money, and energy.

6. I find writing fiction extremely difficult. If I had worked as hard in school as I do now, I might have a Ph.D. in math and physics.

7. It took a long time to get used to living in L.A. due to the stress of everyday living, but I appreciate the variety here.

8. I am proud of my relationships with my friends and family, understanding that it takes time and energy to maintain them.

9. I wish I were taller and didn't have to wear glasses, but I am patient and have been commended for my patience by strangers.

10. I argued with someone in traffic about two weeks ago, which is rare for me as it takes a lot to express anger.

11. I swim to relax, and the last time I swam was last Friday.

12. I have not been diagnosed with PTSD or any psychological acronym.
