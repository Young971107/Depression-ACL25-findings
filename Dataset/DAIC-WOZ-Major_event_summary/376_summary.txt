1. I have been feeling depressed for quite some time, especially after my mother died and then my uncle died four months later. I'm still trying to get myself back together and have recently started pursuing interests I used to enjoy.

2. I was diagnosed with depression ten to fifteen years ago and have always taken medication for it.

3. Last year, my mother died, and I wish I had handled that differently.

4. I have been arguing with everyone, feeling desperate and hopeless, and I attempted to take my own life years ago, which led to hospitalization and starting therapy.

5. I was my mother's caregiver before she passed away, and even though it was overwhelming, I was happier then than I am now.

6. My son passed away, and that was a difficult experience for me.

7. I have been on a diet due to overeating after my mom died, trying to lose weight because it's unhealthy for me.

8. I have trouble sleeping, often waking up in the middle of the night and struggling to get back to sleep.

9. I have a psychiatrist who prescribes me medication regularly.

10. I love the beach and mountains, enjoy hiking, and live close to the beach, which I like to walk along.
