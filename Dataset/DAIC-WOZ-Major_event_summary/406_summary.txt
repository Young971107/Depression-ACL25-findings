1. I haven't traveled in about five years because I just haven't been able to.
2. The hardest decision I probably had to make was moving back to California from Oregon.
3. The last time I felt really happy was yesterday.
4. I argued with my boyfriend because he hung up in my face, but it got solved pretty quickly.
5. The last fun activity I did was ice skating in December in downtown L.A.
6. The last trip I took was to San Francisco, where I stayed downtown, went shopping, and rode a streetcar.
7. I decided to go back to school, went to junior college, and chose psychology as my major because I liked the courses and thought it didn't have a lot of math.
