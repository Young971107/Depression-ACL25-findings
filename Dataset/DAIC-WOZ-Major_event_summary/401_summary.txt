1. I wish I could erase from my memory how a friend I was dating responded to me when I told him my grandmother was ill.

2. I regret not making different decisions when I was younger regarding career and relationship choices, and I wish I had pursued some things earlier in my life.

3. I wish I had handled a situation differently by following my first instinct to get money upfront when agreeing to be roommates temporarily.

4. I felt really happy when my roommate moved out.

5. I have a close relationship with my family, but it's been an adjustment since my grandmother recently passed away.

6. The hardest decision I made was leaving home when I was eighteen, and I felt like I was abandoning my family, but they encouraged me to live my life.
