1. I faced a significant event with my uncle that had a major impact on my life, and I never thought I would have to deal with such a situation. I'll never forget it, but time has helped heal the wounds.

2. I am proud of my welding certificates and being certified by the American Welding Society. It's one of my biggest achievements, although I haven't been working on cars lately despite having a knack for restoration.

3. I have struggled with losing my temper since I was a child, and it has gotten me into trouble, but I'm working on it.

4. I sought help because I was in a state of mind where I was going to get myself into trouble. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder and take medication for it.

5. I recently lost my uncle, who raised me since I was seven years old. He was my last living relative, and his passing has been difficult, but I'm starting to get over it.

6. The hardest decision I ever had to make was authorizing the doctors to let my uncle pass away when he was on life support. It was a very upsetting experience, but I'm slowly getting better.

7. I was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, possibly due to depression from my uncle's death. I'm being monitored by a neurologist and hope it's not the beginning stages of Alzheimer's.

8. When I was younger, I got into trouble by following the wrong crowd and having an ego bigger than my common sense. I wish I could have made different choices back then.

9. If I could give advice to my younger self, it would be to not listen to others and make better decisions, as my past has limited my opportunities.

10. I was born in Brooklyn, New York, but moved to California when I was seven and consider myself a Californian.

11. I need to lose weight, and the neurologist suggested it might be due to the event with my uncle. It's been challenging to find the willpower to exercise and eat healthily.
