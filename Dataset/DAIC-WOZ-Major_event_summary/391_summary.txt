1. I had to move out of my previous place about two weeks ago because there were marijuana plants, which I didn't want to be around.
2. A few years ago, I had a mentor who taught me to never complain and to be thankful for everything I have.
3. I drove through the South, visiting Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and finally California, getting to see the country a little bit.
4. I was really happy over two years ago when I didn't have any money problems and was doing fine.
5. I would advise my younger self not to spend so much money because I would need it in the future.
6. I recently enjoyed being with my cats at home in California while they played outside.
7. I have a better life in California, but I miss home.
8. It's harder to get my own place because I don't have enough money, so I have to live with roommates.
9. I enjoy traveling because I get to see different places, cultures, buildings, and food.
