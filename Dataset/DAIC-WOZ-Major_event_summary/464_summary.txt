1. When I was a kid, I scribbled on walls with Crayola, and that love for art stuck with me, leading me to pursue art classes in general education.

2. My dream job is to get paid for painting art.

3. The last time I argued with someone was with my father because I wanted to eat food, but he wanted me to buy wine. I handled it by deciding to eat in peace after doing him the favor.

4. I am most proud of my paintings because they are unique and have my signature.

5. I sometimes regret not completing a whole university education, but I feel like if I really wanted to go, I would have.

6. I chose to pursue my own learning by connecting with people in the field I want to be in, rather than continuing formal education, which was a hard choice but led me to meet the right people.

7. I have had experiences with being at gunpoint and with a knife, which scarred me but also taught me to be more aware and avoid dangerous situations.

8. I know what it's like to be depressed, but I haven't been diagnosed by a doctor. Depression feels like being limited, like a bird in a cage or a fish that can't swim.

9. To relax, I paint, especially using the colors blue and green, which calm me down. I also smoke weed, which helps me relax.

10. Lately, I've been feeling good and like I have free will, with many paths open to me, and I'm deciding which one to take.
