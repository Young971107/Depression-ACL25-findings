1. I went out with my son, daughter-in-law, and daughter to have Hawaiian food, and we got together at my house on Christmas, which I really enjoyed.
2. I argued with my daughter about her messy room, which is a recurring issue we've had for years.
3. I sought help because I didn't feel well and couldn't pull myself out of it, experiencing symptoms like sadness and lack of energy.
4. I flew to Cedar Rapids to visit a friend and stayed for a couple of weeks, and I'm planning to fly back on February 11th to see him again.
5. I have a new boyfriend, and things were going really great about a month ago, but now they're just okay as the newness wore off.
6. I was diagnosed with depression about a year ago and still go to therapy, which helps me talk about my feelings even though I don't feel many changes.
7. I feel tired, sad, depressed, and blue lately, and I cope by staying to myself and not going out with friends as much.
8. I don't sleep well, which makes me feel crazy and distracted, making it hard to cope with mundane things.
