2. I recently went camping on a beach with a bunch of friends, which I really enjoyed.
3. I was told I am a part-time member in my current band and not officially in the core group, which made me feel pretty bad for a few days.
4. I regret not finishing college and not transferring to a four-year university to get a bachelor's degree.
5. I had a really good band practice last night with all my friends, which made me feel really happy.
6. I went to Russia three years ago and enjoyed visiting all the churches in the area.
7. When I was a boy, I stole a little golden bicycle from an old lady, and I'm not proud of it.
8. I live with my parents at twenty-three years old, which is becoming more awkward, and I think I need to move out and get my own apartment.
9. I wish I could change my work ethic because I have difficulty completing the projects I plan for myself.
10. I play a lot of music to relax, often sitting down with a guitar for a little while.
11. My dream job is to be a touring and performing musician, but it's really hard due to a lot of competition and luck involved.
