1. I feel really happy when I'm around someone I like, playing games, talking, and doing a book club together.
2. I love my living situation with roommates near the beach, where I can walk and hang out with friends, feeling like I'm on vacation.
3. I meditate almost every day, walk on the beach, and enjoy the peacefulness of the ocean.
4. I traveled to Singapore in February with a friend, flying first class using frequent flyer miles, which was a great experience.
5. I feel guilty about not spending enough time with my nephew on the east coast, as I used to when I lived closer.
6. I moved to L.A. about five and a half years ago, and it was one of the best decisions I've made.
7. I wish I had more self-discipline, could eat healthier, not procrastinate, and be in a relationship.
