1. I had a teacher in sixth grade who made me feel really bad about myself because I wasn't the best student, but his diligence helped me develop a passion for school and overcome that feeling.

2. My grandmother, who raised me, passed away when I was eleven. She was the matriarch of our family, and it was tough losing her, but I've grown a lot since then.

3. I was definitely shy as a kid, but through the experience of college, I've grown into myself and become more outspoken.

4. I write music and work out to relieve stress, often doing push-ups and lifting weights.

5. I finally managed to dunk at the basketball court across the street at the Clippers center after working on it for a while.

6. I regret not applying to UC schools in time during my senior year of high school, as I believe I would have been admitted.

7. I saw a therapist as a kid for about a year, which taught me to control my emotions, although I tend to bottle them up instead of expressing them.

8. I have a few tickets due to missing court dates, which has been tough to deal with financially while trying to make something out of my life.

9. I have four close friends I've known for over eight years, and they are studious, hardworking, and determined.

10. I wish I had a faster metabolism, but overall, I'm pretty content with myself.
