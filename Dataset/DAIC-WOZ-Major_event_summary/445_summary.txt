1. I wish I could handle situations better when things don't go my way, by calming down and counting my blessings.
2. I argued with my girlfriend last night because she thought my tone was too loud, even though I wasn't angry.
3. I wish I could erase the memory of my mother being sick and dependent on oxygen for three years.
4. I worked on cruise ships as a musical entertainer and traveled to places like Alaska, Korea, Japan, and the Caribbean.
5. I survived a snowstorm while traveling on a small airplane in Galena, Alaska.
6. I chose not to tell my mother that her condition had worsened to spare her fear, even though it was difficult for me.
