1. I made the decision to serve the Lord and do the right things.
2. I started going to church and gave my life to the Lord because I knew I needed to.
3. I went to Disneyland with my son for his birthday and my daughter, and I really enjoyed that.
4. I flew back home to visit my family, whom I hadn't seen in a couple of years, and it was pretty cool.
5. I am studying culinary arts in college because I like cooking and decided to get an education on it.
6. I flew in an airplane for the first time and felt nervous because I had never been on a plane before.
7. I moved to L.A. and found it pretty hard to get used to the different environment, but I like the weather and the many things to do.
