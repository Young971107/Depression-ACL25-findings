1. I moved to L.A. about five years ago for a change of scenery and try to go back to my hometown every year, but I'm still trying to get used to living in L.A.
2. I wish I had an education and a better job, and I want to go to school and stay in school to learn.
3. I feel guilty about not having money for the bills, not having a job, and not doing anything with my life.
4. I had to make a hard decision about what kind of car to buy, which involved a lot of research, looking at magazines, and going on the internet to see what was in my budget.
5. I play with my dog whenever I get super bored or need some time for myself, and it makes me feel really happy.
6. I've become more shy and reserved, building walls around myself, and I argue all the time.
7. I feel aggravated when I don't sleep well, and I've been feeling a little down, restless, and moody with no appetite.
8. I like to joke and have fun, but when things don't go my way, it really makes me mad.
