1. I was raped and sodomized, and they kept a gun to my head and cut my hair, so I've been going through a hell of a thing lately.
2. I went through nursing school and I'm happy I did that, but I'm not working in that field anymore.
3. I have one son, and he's a beautiful child. Being a parent is not easy, and decision-making is the hardest part.
4. I like to read and watch television to relax, and I think I'm very good at controlling my temper.
5. I have triggers, like seeing four men together with hoods on or going upstairs, because of what happened to me.
6. My mother taught me to cook, and that was very valuable to me.
7. I haven't been to therapy in a while, but it helped me realize a lot of things from my past were still deep down inside me.
8. I was diagnosed with PTSD a few years ago, and I sought help because I wanted to get revenge on the guys that raped me. I don't go to therapy now, but I'm going to go back.
