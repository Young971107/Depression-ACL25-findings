1. I visited the pyramids in Mexico City to learn about my ancient Mayan and Aztec culture.
2. I dropped out of school but returned to study graphic design.
3. I moved to Los Angeles with my family for a better life.
4. I have visited my hometown in Mexico three or four times for vacation and find it less stressful than Los Angeles.
5. I argued with someone about a bill two days ago, even though I had already taken care of it.
6. I felt overwhelmed waiting for a check, despite having made proper arrangements.
7. I aspire to have my own business, possibly making web pages, to have freedom and not rely on others.
8. I felt demeaned when visiting Mexico because of how I was treated until they saw my American credit card.
9. I regret dropping out of school and wish I had handled past decisions differently.
10. My brother was involved in gangs, which led to unpleasant memories I prefer not to discuss.
11. I enjoy spending my ideal weekend relaxing with my girlfriend, either going out or staying at home without interruptions.
