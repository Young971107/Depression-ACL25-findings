1. I went to New Zealand not too long ago, stayed there for a week, learned about Celsius, played cricket, learned to get out of a capsized kayak, and enjoyed the local lamb and chocolate. The people were really nice, and it was a special time for me.

2. I had a film festival that I was putting together, and despite things going wrong, I was really happy when the house was packed with people about a month ago.

3. I put together a short film with a minimal budget, featuring amazing actors and a great storyline. I'm proud of this accomplishment and believe it will take me and my film crew to higher heights.

4. I argued with my fianc√©e a couple of months ago about something petty, but it didn't last long because we both prefer to resolve things quickly.

5. I regret not going up to Will Smith when I had the chance.
