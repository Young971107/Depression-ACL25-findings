1. I was diagnosed with PTSD a few months ago, about in the last six months, after experiencing mental issues like paranoia and anxiety that I couldn't overcome by myself.

2. My parents have always been very supportive and loving, giving me feedback about my decisions while allowing me to make my own choices in life.

3. My sisters have always been looking out for me and checking in with me since I'm the youngest in the family.

4. My boyfriend has been very supportive, especially with an incident that happened, understanding when I don't want to go out in public due to anxiety.

5. I moved from Pennsylvania to L.A. about three and a half years ago after living in Boston for a couple of years because I wasn't satisfied with the quality of my life.

6. I have difficulty being in public due to anxiety and paranoia, preferring to go out in the mornings and evenings, and avoiding places with only one way in and out.

7. I've been gradually trying to increase how much I'm outside, using deep breathing exercises to cope with anxiety, and have improved over the last couple of months.

8. Initially, I had difficulty sleeping through the night, waking up multiple times, but now I'm sleeping through the night again.

9. I feel more like myself lately, which is a huge improvement, and I'm more cautious and guarded about my thoughts and decisions.

10. I regret taking a job where I was assaulted, going into a retail environment that was unsafe and not listening to my gut.
