1. In November, I was very depressed and suicidal, so I told my friend what I was feeling and that she needed to take me to the ER. From there, I had the choice to go home or get sent to a mental hospital. Even though it felt like I didn't have a choice, I knew it was my decision, and I chose to go to the mental hospital, which turned out to be the worst experience of my life.

2. I had been so depressed for about a month that I stopped going to my classes and work, lied to my teachers about being sick, kept calling in sick to work, dropped a class, and was failing my classes. I wasn't talking to any of my friends, was drinking a lot, passing out, and vomiting everywhere. I was in a really bad place, and when I finally was going to kill myself, I realized I needed help.

3. After I got out of the hospital, I finally had one good day. My friend took me into downtown Chicago, and we went to the Sears Tower. We got to look over those big windows that you walk out on and see the city, and that was really cool.

4. I traveled from Los Angeles to Chicago taking Route 66, and the best part was seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time. It was the coolest thing I've ever seen, and I felt happy. It was beautiful, and I hadn't felt like that in a long time.

5. I had severe depression when I was a younger teenager and tried to kill myself then. I got put in therapy for quite some time, and I figured I didn't want to go down that bad path again. I just wanted to get better, so I had to seek help. I still go to therapy once a week.
