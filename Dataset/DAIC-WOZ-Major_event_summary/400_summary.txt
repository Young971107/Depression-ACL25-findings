1. I was handling money for a business partner, and they ended up short. I was blamed for it, but it was actually due to a change I made in the formulas for crunching the numbers. The blame was on me, and I felt bad because of my uncertainty about the formula change.

2. One of my most memorable experiences was a trip to Texas where we spent time in the desert, shot guns, and rode go-karts.

3. My mom passed away about two months ago, and my dad and I are not really talking much.

4. I believe therapy is useful because it helps in overall health and mental health by allowing you to look inward and readjust to problems.

5. I stopped therapy because I felt I had overcome a chapter in my life where the doctor was taking control of my health, and I started exploring alternative routes like juicing and nutrition.

6. I wish I could change how I listen to my inner conscious more than what my brain wants, like avoiding caffeine and sugar.

7. I feel guilty about not supporting my friends as much with their career choices.

8. I recently enjoyed going to the wholesale food market in downtown Los Angeles.

9. I was diagnosed with depression over five years ago, and my symptoms included loss of appetite, loss of motivation, and fear of social situations.
