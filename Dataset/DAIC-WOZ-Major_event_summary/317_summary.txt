1. I felt overwhelmed and anxious about some things that had happened, so I went into therapy for a while.
2. I moved from New York to L.A. about two years ago because I wanted a change of environment and to start over somewhere.
3. I was diagnosed with PTSD about ten years ago.
4. I studied in Paris a long time ago, and it was a fun time meeting new people at the schools there.
5. I finished grad school and some training at a seamanship maritime school, which I am most proud of in my life.
6. I have been diagnosed with depression and have been feeling kind of depressed, tired, sluggish, less motivated, and less interested in things lately.
7. My family and I no longer keep in touch since my parents passed away, so I am pretty alone.
