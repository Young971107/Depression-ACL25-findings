1. I was diagnosed with depression a long time ago and have taken many medications, but recently, in the last six months, I decided to stop taking anything to let my body return to a normal state.

2. I sought help after being beaten up and experiencing identity theft, which left me afraid to go out. I spent a year at home, depressed, before deciding to start talking to people again.

3. I used to move every couple of years to a different city, but now I've been in the same place for a while and don't travel much.

4. I quit drinking altogether recently because I didn't like how I acted when I drank, and I couldn't afford it.

5. I moved to L.A. when I was twenty-five, had fun, got into real estate, did well, but then the market crashed, and now times are tough.

6. I argued with someone who owed me money the last time I had an argument.

7. One of my most memorable experiences was when my father told my brother and me to go to the car, and we found a new dog and a bag of dog food.

8. I realized that drinking was a problem because it was a depressant, and stopping it has given me a clearer mind.

9. My mother has been a very positive influence in my life, keeping me on track, and we are very close.

10. I regret the way I treated people when I was hurting, being mean or rude, but since I stopped drinking, I don't do that anymore.
