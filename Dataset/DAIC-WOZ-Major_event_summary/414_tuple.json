{"In November, I was very depressed and suicidal, so I told my friend what I was feeling and that she needed to take me to the ER. From there, I had the choice to go home or get sent to a mental hospital. Even though it felt like I didn't have a choice, I knew it was my decision, and I chose to go to the mental hospital, which turned out to be the worst experience of my life.\n": "1. <Participant, told, friend what I was feeling>\n2. <Participant, told, friend that she needed to take me to the ER>\n3. <Participant, chose, to go to the mental hospital>", "\n": "There is no conversation provided to extract events from.
