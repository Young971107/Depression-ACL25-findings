1. I took money from my mom's purse when I was in junior high school to buy candy for my friends, and I felt guilty about it the same day.
2. Last year, I went to Sacramento and stayed for about a month living in my VW bus with my wife, which was kind of cool and like camping.
3. I argued with my brother about him talking to me with more respect as a person.
4. I met my wife at an art walk, and we've known each other for about two years.
