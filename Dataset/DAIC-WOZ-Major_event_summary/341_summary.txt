3. I served in the Navy for four years, and it made me more responsible compared to some of my friends who didn't join the military.

4. I argued with my mother because she thinks I should stay home more since I'm married with children, but I wanted to socialize with ex co-workers.

5. I find it hard to be a parent, especially raising a child with a disability, but I love my children and they are a blessing.

6. My mom can be intrusive and gets in my business, which frustrates me, but I love her and don't want to be mad at her.

7. I go to bed early and wake up early, which gives me a good night's sleep, but if I don't sleep well, I become moody and irritable.

8. I am currently attending Harbor College and am happy about it, although I wish I had started sooner.

9. I try to cope with frustrations by taking walks and not thinking about them too much.

10. My mom has been a positive influence in my life, even though she sometimes tries to re-raise me.
