1. I felt really happy a few weeks ago when I made a lot of money and felt ahead of the game with rent and bills under control.

2. Some people made me feel bad by saying my decision to move was not feasible and a pipe dream, but I take insults in stride and welcome constructive criticism.

3. I moved to L.A. in 2004 to pursue a film career, which was challenging but fun, and it took a couple of years to get used to it.

4. Leaving my comfort zone in South Carolina to move to L.A. was hard but exciting, with a mix of excitement and anxiety.

5. I wish I had been more disciplined growing up, especially with schoolwork, but I had a good childhood overall.

6. I haven't been to Vegas in five years, but I've gone to casinos with my brother, which is fun.

7. I like that L.A. has warm weather, no snow, and lots to do with beaches, but the traffic and cost of living are high.

8. I argued with someone over a basketball game, but it was more of a debate and pretty tame.

9. I have a strong family support system, which has been a positive influence in my life.
