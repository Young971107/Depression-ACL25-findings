1. A few years back, I was dating a guy who wanted me to move back to where he was from. I decided to move there and try to do event planning on the East Coast, but it didn't work out.

2. I remember in second grade, people used to make fun of me because I was very tall and skinny, and I had straight A's, one of the highest grades in the class.

3. I got press passes for the Sunset Strip Music Festival through a friend and got to meet rockstars and hang out at private parties.

4. Recently, I went up to Oceanside to visit a friend I hadn't seen in six months. We went out for burgers, hung out on the beach, and took her two-year-old son to the park.

5. When I was seventeen, I ran away with my boyfriend to upstate New York to Watertown. We had an apartment there, it snowed a lot, and we sold antiques for a living.
