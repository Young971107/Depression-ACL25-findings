1. I am currently studying physical therapy and about to become a licensed massage therapist. Before that, I was involved in music composition, writing scores for films, animations, dance productions, and theater productions.

2. Yesterday, I was chilling in downtown with a friend from New York, and we were discussing writing. We weren't arguing, but we were sharing opinions about how sometimes things are not ready to be written.

3. I once took a year off while my friend was going to school, and we shared an apartment with another friend. It didn't turn out as expected, and I ended up leaving before the lease ended, which led to us separating. I wish I had handled it more thoughtfully.

4. A hard decision I had to make was leaving school and dropping my continuation of achieving a BFA.

5. Last year, I went to Los Banos in Central California. It was a different energy from LA, with no phones, no wifi, and no TV. I worked at a hot spring resort, hiked, farmed, and did carpentry, enjoying the raw and real atmosphere.

6. I feel really happy a lot, and one of those moments was this morning while biking, enjoying the sun and the breeze.

7. I love traveling because it allows me to escape the city and see the world as it really is, free from man-made constraints.

8. Recently, I've been collaborating with artists on mixed media projects, and I've discovered my ability to work well with others in an artistic context.

9. To relax, I breathe, chill, make a smoothie or tea, and go bike riding or write.
