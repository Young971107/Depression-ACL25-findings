1. I went to France a few years ago for a wedding, visited Paris, and a small town where the wedding took place in a thousand-year-old church.
2. I was in a relationship for about four years, took my partner for granted, and now regret not committing as I believe we were meant for each other.
3. I stopped going to therapy because I didn't feel it was helping me.
4. I sang karaoke with friends recently and had a lot of fun.
5. I feel guilty about not being as good of a friend as I could be and not being able to help people with their problems.
6. I feel pretty happy whenever I see my nephew and my best friend's children.
7. I wish I could be healthier, more energetic, more outgoing, and more social.
8. I regret not marrying the girl I think I should have married.
9. I sought help because I was missing a lot of school, which led to seeing a therapist, psychologist, and psychiatrist.
