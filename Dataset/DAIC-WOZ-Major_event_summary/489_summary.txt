1. I argued with someone a couple of days ago about a musical project I was involved in, and I felt heated in that moment.

2. I went to a concert, saw live music, and drank good beer.

3. I had a bad performance one time and wished people I knew didn't see it because we weren't well rehearsed, and I was embarrassed afterwards.

4. I went to Alaska on a fishing trip and caught an octopus while deep sea fishing for halibut.

5. I moved to Los Angeles to go to school and studied music industry.

6. I visit my hometown about once a month, which is small, quiet, and has fresh air compared to Los Angeles.

7. I am proud of being healthy, understanding the world around me, being passionate about what I'm doing, and working towards goals I've set.
