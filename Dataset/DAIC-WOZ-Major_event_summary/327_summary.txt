1. About a month ago, I argued with my daughter about her finances.
2. I moved from Montreal, Canada to Los Angeles with my mom when I was in high school.
3. I went from full-time to part-time work and decided to go back to school due to less work in the automotive field.
4. I was diagnosed with PTSD two years and two months ago, and I sought help due to loneliness and depression after not having any family members left in the United States.
5. When I was young, my sister was kidnapped, which made me worry a lot about my children when they were growing up.
6. I don't travel much anymore because I don't have much family in the United States, and it's expensive to go back home, so I only go every couple of years.
7. Seeing a therapist has helped me cope with things, and I realized I had to do something after feeling depressed for so long.
