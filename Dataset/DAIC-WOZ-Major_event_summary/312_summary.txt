1. Twenty years ago, I was fifteen, and I would advise myself to keep doing what I was doing because it worked out well for me.
2. I feel happy when I have a good workout, do well in video games, or when my research in mathematics or physics goes well.
3. I started off in school reading about Einstein and got interested in particle physics and quantum mechanics, eventually realizing I could do research in physics and contribute to scientific knowledge.
4. Serving in the military didn't change me much because I grew up expecting it, and after the military, I went to graduate school in physics.
5. I teach community college physics and astronomy, do research in physics, and plan to go back to grad school.
6. I am most proud of the research I have done and making it this far in my research career.
7. I am really good at math, patient, and disciplined, spending many hours reading books that might be important.
8. A few weeks ago, I felt really happy when I got a good grade in a class.
9. I am applying to grad school again, feeling apprehensive but hopeful.
10. I argued with my brother about video games, which is a rare occurrence since I'm single and don't argue much.
11. I am fairly close to my family, seeing my parents and brother often and tutoring my sister's kids.
12. I am introverted, spending long periods doing math and reading, and I relax by playing video games and working out.
13. I used to travel a lot for school conferences but not as much now, and I don't enjoy traveling.
