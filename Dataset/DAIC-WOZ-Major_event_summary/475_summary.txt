1. I recently went to Palm Springs with my wife and friends, and it was really nice; it was a hundred degrees outside, and we laid by the pool and barbecued.
2. I was the first person in my family to graduate from college, which was kind of a big deal.
3. I got together with a couple of my friends and played a round of golf, enjoying the sunshine on a nice day.
4. I run, go to the gym, and surf a lot. When I'm stressed, I try to go to the gym or wake up earlier to surf before work.
5. I feel a little bit of the side effects because my wife is pregnant; it's our first, so I'm unfamiliar with the feelings.
6. I struggle with going to sleep, even though I get a good night's sleep; it's hard to go to sleep.
7. My dream job is to work for a big golf company and do their advertising for them.
8. I feel guilty about not providing for my family as much as I'd like to.
9. I wish I could have a little bit more confidence.
10. I was raised by a good family and trained myself to be a hard worker, hoping to be successful one day and become the CEO of my company.
