1. I was born in Canada but have lived in California most of my life. I haven't gone back to my hometown in a long time.
2. I found out my thyroid is acting up, which might be affecting my energy levels.
3. I live in an apartment where the person above me takes showers and does laundry late at night, which affects my sleep.
4. I was working in social services, have worked in sales, and am currently a part-time leasing consultant in real estate.
5. I moved to San Francisco for a job once, but being single made it easier since I didn't have to consider a family.
6. My dad is no longer here, and my mom and I have our differences. I get along great with my brother and sister.
7. I wish I could lose weight, as it's a common struggle and would give me more energy.
8. I love movies, going out with friends, shopping, swap meets, and traveling, especially road trips.
