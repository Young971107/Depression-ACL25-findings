1. I went on a trip with a geology class around six months ago.
2. The first time I went camping was really memorable; I went to Death Valley and saw cool things with friends.
3. I regret how I treated my mother when I was a kid and not doing well in school a couple of semesters ago.
4. I went to a party with my boyfriend, felt comfortable, met new people, and had fun.
5. My relationship with my mom improved after moving out, and I get along well with my siblings now.
6. I got into trouble a few months back, had to do community service, procrastinated, and faced a mean judge.
7. When I was nineteen, I came home late from a party, my dad got mad, and we didn't speak for about a year.
8. The last time I argued with someone was probably with my boyfriend about going to a party when I wasn't feeling well.
