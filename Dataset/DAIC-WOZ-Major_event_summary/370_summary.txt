1. When I was fourteen, I went on a trip with my parents to Austria, Hungary, and Romania, where I got to see old castles and experience a different way of life.

2. I am proud of the level of education I've achieved and am starting a Ph.D. program in the fall. I'm also happy about breaking some bad habits and having strong relationships with my family and friends.

3. I regret not trying harder in my younger days, particularly during a period in my early twenties when I didn't work and spent time with a bad crowd.

4. I got engaged on Labor Day in 2012, and I'm getting married in a few months. This whole process has been a very happy time in my life.

5. I wish the last car accident I was in hadn't happened. It was a slow rear-end collision during rush hour traffic, and the timing was financially unfortunate for me.

6. One of my most memorable experiences was taking a solo trip to New Mexico when I was about twenty-three, where I explored for ten days without any traveling companions.
