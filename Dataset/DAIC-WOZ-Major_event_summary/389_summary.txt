1. I went to San Diego about a month and a half ago.
2. I finished high school and was glad to be leaving.
3. I decided not to marry my fianc√©e and pursued my career instead.
4. I moved to L.A. for work and grad school, and it wasn't easy to get used to living there because people suck.
5. I was diagnosed with depression around high school, and my family made me seek help.
6. I had a stressful grad school audition at Juilliard.
7. I argued with someone three days ago because a dude cut me off while I was driving.
8. I started learning how to surf, and it was pretty chill.
