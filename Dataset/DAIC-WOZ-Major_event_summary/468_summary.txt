1. My girlfriend's family has been very positive in my life, influencing me to achieve higher in life by showing me the importance of higher education and long-term thinking.
2. I decided not to move to Colorado for my undergrad a few years ago, which was a tough decision because I sometimes wonder "what if."
3. I'm feeling a little stressed because finals are next week, but I'm excited to graduate in two weeks and look forward to going to Maui and planning summer trips.
4. I'm proud to be graduating with my bachelor's degree, working at a law firm, and being a motivated and determined person with an open mind.
5. The last time I felt really happy was seeing my girlfriend graduate from nursing school, which made me really proud of her.
6. I went caving two weeks ago at Sequoia National Park for a recreational tourism management class, which was a lot of fun and a great experience.
