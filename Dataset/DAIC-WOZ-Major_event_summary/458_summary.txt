1. I've been interested in real estate since 2005, and I'm planning to start as a real estate agent, hoping to get my license this year.

2. I lived in Hawaii for a year and a half, and to relax, I usually take a nap, a bath, or try to focus on positive activities.

3. I had to make the hard decision to get a divorce, which was one of the hardest decisions I've faced.

4. I used to travel with my dad, which is one of my most memorable experiences.

5. I wish I could control my temper better, lose weight, be more active, and have clearer skin.

6. I was made to feel really badly about myself during my school years because of how the kids treated me.

7. I still argue with my ex-husband, often over small things that snowball out of control.

8. I wish I had handled various situations in my life differently, but I don't regret anything I've done.

9. I finally got over how the kids treated me at school, which is something I once wished I could erase from my memory.

10. I'm proud of myself and my kids.
