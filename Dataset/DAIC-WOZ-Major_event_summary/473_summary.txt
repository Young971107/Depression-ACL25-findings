1. I moved to Los Angeles from New Jersey five years ago because the weather is nice and there's more to do here, like the art and music scene.
2. I enjoy visiting my family and try to go back to my hometown about once a year; it's always nice to see what they're up to.
3. I recently did karaoke, which I really enjoy.
4. I took a lot of art courses throughout high school and still work a little in art.
5. Deciding to move away from my family and come out here was a difficult decision, but I'm happy I did it.
6. I have a very good relationship with my family and talk to them almost every day.
7. My mom taught me to be the person I am today.
8. Whenever I go to the gym, I feel really happy; I felt happy yesterday.
