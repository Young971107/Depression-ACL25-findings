1. After my husband and I ended our relationship, I moved to L.A. because I had family there, and I thought it would be easier to start over there than in other places I had lived or to stay where we were.

2. I moved to L.A. in 2007, but my family had moved there many years earlier, about forty years ago.

3. I don't go back to Detroit anymore because I don't like the weather, and most of my immediate family is in California.

4. I grew up in a home with dysfunction and domestic abuse, which involved many traumatic incidents.

5. I wish I had handled some situations differently, especially when I got emotional with my husband over things he made a big deal about.

6. I regret not moving to California sooner and buying a different house, but I made the best decision I could at the time with the information I had.

7. I have traveled worldwide, including Europe and South America, and I enjoy new experiences from traveling.

8. I have a good relationship with my siblings, though some have experienced different levels of stress and trauma.

9. I find happiness in everyday moments, like a great meal or a beautiful view, rather than big celebratory events.

10. I have been feeling less stressed lately as I get more things done and work on several projects.
