1. I wish I had handled my second marriage differently. My wife wanted children, but I already had children from my first marriage and didn't want more. We initially agreed on this, but when her best friend got pregnant, our relationship changed, and I wouldn't relent, leading to our divorce.

2. I feel guilty about not being there for my mother when she got sick. I was in a bad situation, but that doesn't excuse the fact that I wasn't there the way I should have been.

3. I had a friend who was run over in a crosswalk and is now on life support, which has affected me deeply.

4. I had my dream job doing sports research for Native American tribes, but it's not as frequent now due to the existence of sports bureaus.

5. I had to make the difficult decision to take my father off life support, which is something I wish I could erase from my memory.

6. I argued with my youngest daughter about a year and a half ago.
