1. I moved to L.A. in 2008, and initially, it was easy to adapt because it was a new experience. However, after a few years, it became more difficult as I realized how different life is out here compared to where I'm from.

2. I regret the college I chose to go to because I didn't realize Santa Monica College was more like a transfer school and not a place where I could get a bachelor's degree.

3. I had an argument with my dad a few days ago, which created more problems for me.

4. I wish I had handled recurring arguments differently by biting my tongue instead of letting them turn into explosive fights.

5. I had some breathing problems and went to the hospital, where they told me it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety.

6. I was interested in photography since high school, participated in programs, received awards, and decided to pursue art, eventually earning a fine arts degree.

7. I enjoy working or interning in forensics, which I find more secure and interesting than my initial interest in freelance photography.

8. I regret not staying closer to home and pursuing other options instead of being completely invested in moving to California.

9. I have progressively become more seclusive and reserved over the years, not as outgoing as I used to be.

10. I was happy when I was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the New Year's holiday, where I could relax and not worry about responsibilities.

11. I went to therapy as a kid because my parents thought it would help with issues they were having with me, but I didn't feel like I needed it at the time.

12. I recently went to a Clippers basketball game with a friend who was visiting, and I really enjoyed it.

13. I watch reality television, like Bravo TV and The Real Housewives shows, to relax because they are funny and lighthearted.

14. I have trouble staying asleep, waking up like clockwork by 7:30 or 8:00 in the morning, and I can't figure out why I can't sleep longer.
