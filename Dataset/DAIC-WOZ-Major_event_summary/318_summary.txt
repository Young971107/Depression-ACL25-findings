1. When I was younger, I was in the Boy Scouts, and we went camping all the time. One year, we went to Yellowstone or Yosemite, and I worked on a mountain biking merit badge. It was intense and fun, going downhill at about forty-five miles an hour in dirt on a bicycle. I'll never forget that experience.
2. The last trip I had was to Vegas. It was pretty fun with a lot of drinking and partying going on.
3. Recently, I had a New Year's Eve party, and I had the time of my life. It was so fun.
4. I studied business administration and business management in school.
5. My dream job is to open up a big clothing line and supply the whole world with clothing.
