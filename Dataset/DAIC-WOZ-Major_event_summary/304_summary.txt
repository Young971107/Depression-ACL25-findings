1. I went on a cruise to Mexico with my family when I was sixteen, which was a happy experience.
2. I met my boyfriend through a mutual friend in LA about six months ago.
3. I felt very betrayed and belittled by my little sister about a month ago because she disrespected me.
4. I regret moving in with my current roommates because I connect more with someone else I could have lived with.
5. I often believe what people say without proof and give people too many chances, which has led to mistakes.
