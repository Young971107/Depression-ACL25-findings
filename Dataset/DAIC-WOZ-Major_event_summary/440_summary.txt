1. I often feel guilty when I yell at my children because I was yelled at a lot as a child, and I try hard to avoid handling situations with them in that way.
2. I have trouble sleeping on weekends because I worry about my older kids being out with their friends, and sometimes I get so exhausted from lack of sleep that I just pass out.

4. I was diagnosed with depression about three years ago, and my OB-GYN suggested I see a psychiatrist.
5. I have three children, and I find parenting challenging because of the different stages they go through.
6. I recently visited my son, who is dealing with legal issues and is currently incarcerated, and I felt happy that he was safe.
7. I am in the process of changing therapists because the program I was in lost funding, but therapy was an important part of my life and helped me cope.
8. I enjoy designing jewelry to relax, and I am preparing to go back to work after staying home with my youngest child.
9. I recently argued with my husband about whether I ever thought about cheating, and I felt tired of discussing the same topic.
