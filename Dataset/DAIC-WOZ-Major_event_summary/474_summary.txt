1. I was born in Hawaii but grew up in Colorado, and I moved to L.A. about seven to eight years ago for work. I love it here and try to go back to my hometown once or twice a year.

2. My grandmother was very positive and encouraging, always telling me to pursue my dreams and not let little things get me down.

3. I felt like I wasn't being heard or listened to in a situation where we couldn't have a real dialogue.

4. I got mad at someone at work about a month ago because I didn't think they were giving me clear instructions, and it led to both of us getting mad.

5. When I was a kid, someone put bandaids on my back with mean messages, and I walked around not knowing why people were laughing at me until someone told me.

6. I wish I could erase the memory of when my grandfather found our dog run over, and it was a moment that frightened me and made me experience loss.

7. I went to Alaska a couple of years ago, went fishing in the ocean, got seasick, and saw a bear in real life.

8. I went to Coachella, a music festival, with my friends and boyfriend, where we danced, swam, barbecued, and had a great time.

9. I recently got a new job, which made me really happy.

10. I am proud of my career and sticking it out in L.A. despite the challenges, as I have always wanted to tell stories and work on writing.

11. I wish I had handled a situation differently when someone cut me off while driving, and I followed them to confront them, which was petty of me.

12. I have been between jobs recently, trying to manage my sleep schedule while not working, and I start a new job next week.
