1. I regret not finishing college because I was going into depression during my senior year and wasn't coping well, which led to not obtaining a degree despite being there for seven years.

2. I was diagnosed with depression in 1980, and my father, who was a psychiatrist, noticed some symptoms that led me to seek help.

3. I have experienced sport success in high school and created memorable art pieces, but my father's death is a very memorable and not good event.

4. I think I should have sought therapy and outside help during certain points in my life, especially with logistics during finals as an art major without a car.

5. I enjoy photographing events, such as a recent soccer game, which I found to be a nice experience.

6. I have been slipping back into depression during periods of unemployment, as I don't do well without structure.

7. I have noticed changes in my behavior, focusing on negative thoughts, such as imagining ancient battles, which I find myself reading about and watching videos on.

8. I have learned from therapy to try to see things without the "depression sunglasses" and check if I'm perceiving things accurately.

9. I have been working as a photographer and also manage an apartment, which provides free rent but ties me down.

10. I have a dream of running a family portrait studio or another type of photography business.

11. I have a supportive family, with my parents and many siblings being positive influences in my life.
