1. I used to live in Mexico City, which was a pretty memorable experience.
2. I moved to L.A. about two years ago to pursue job opportunities, and it was a memorable experience because it took a lot of hard work.
3. I went to London, which was a lot of fun and a pretty cool city, although a little too expensive.
4. I have been diagnosed with depression a few years ago, and I still feel the same as I did when they diagnosed me.
5. I argued with someone a few days ago about getting paid for something I did on time, and I felt pretty pissed off and taken advantage of.
6. I am proud of being able to survive on my own in a city like this completely on my own with no outside help.
7. I felt really happy about six months ago when things were going well and I didn't have much stress in my life.
