1. I experienced the passing of my mother about five years ago, which has been a significant and memorable event in my life.
2. I recently celebrated a birthday with a small, intimate gathering where I cooked a meal, had family and friends over, listened to music, watched a movie, and reminisced about the old days when my mom was with us.
3. I just came back from a trip to Memphis about three weeks ago, where I visited family and friends and enjoyed a change of scenery.
4. I had an argument with my nephew a couple of days ago because he didn't call me back after I had set aside time to spend with him.
5. I have a large family with four sisters and one brother on my mom's side, and six brothers and four sisters on my dad's side, and we are all very close, sometimes too close.
6. I think I might be experiencing depression, especially since my mom passed away and due to the instability of my job situation in California.
