1. I had a pretty scary experience being in a car by myself, unable to control the vehicle, and just hoping I was going to be okay.
2. I almost crashed into the freeway barrier, and the car spun out, almost ending up off a little hill.
3. A police officer pulled me over, thinking I was a drunk driver, and accused me of wrongdoing when I was just very tired.
4. I studied automotive technology and welding because of my passion for cars since I was little.
5. I enjoy drifting my 240SX and spending quality time with my wife and kids.
6. I feel desperate when someone can't decide where to eat, which makes me uneasy.
7. I have traveled in the past but don't go out of state due to budget constraints.
8. I have received traffic violations and wish I hadn't sped through intersections or gotten tickets on my record.
