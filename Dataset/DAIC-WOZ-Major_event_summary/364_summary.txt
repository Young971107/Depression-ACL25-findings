1. This morning, I woke up really happy because I knew it was going to be a nice day with good weather, which always makes me feel better.

2. I used to have a screensaver on one of my computers that helped me relax. I find exercise, like yoga or going for a long walk, helps me relax the best, especially after a stressful day.

3. In 1983, I experienced a situation in the military where our position was shelled, and poison gas was sprayed on us, but it wasn't anything too intense.

4. My father passed away recently, and I was in charge of the funeral arrangements. I wish I had invited more people to the service.

5. I went to graduate school after the military and got two graduate degrees. I worked in private enterprise, then joined the fire department as a firefighter and paramedic, and later worked in a family business.

6. I am proud of my daughter and my public service, including my military and fire service.

7. I enjoy traveling and have been to sixty-six countries. I don't travel as much as I used to, but I've learned a couple of languages.

8. One of my favorite trips was to Paris, where I stayed for about a month and really got to know the city.

9. I have a close relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family. I wish we were more like a family that got together regularly.

10. I regret not spending more time with my parents before they passed and with my daughter when she was younger.

11. I went to a service academy after high school and became an officer in the military.

12. I don't like the high tax rate and regulations in California, which affect my small business and have caused many peers to move their businesses to other states.
