1. I learned a new song on the guitar, but I didn't feel happy about it. I work sometimes, and that kind of makes me happy, like running fast and working out, but it doesn't make me excited. It just makes me feel good. I have times where I feel good about myself, but I'm never feeling great or happy.

2. I found out my mom didn't tell me the whole story about her health, and I'm worried because she's in the hospital. I'm also trying to find a job, and with a baby on the way, I feel overwhelmed with a lot of things to do.

3. I ran the L.A. Marathon and graduated from college, which feels good, but I don't feel proud of myself for those things alone. They haven't made me successful or thin and trim, so they're like half merits.

4. I regret not canceling the LSAT test because I could have gotten into a school, but then I think about the cost of law school tuition and the work involved.

5. I lost my job about a year and a half, maybe two years ago, due to the bad economy and budget cuts. I wish I was working there again.

6. My mom has diabetes, which she doesn't control, and it affects her health. It always has me worried and stressed out about her. I have a good relationship with my mom and a lot of family and friends who get along with me well.

7. I taught myself how to play guitar, and I play these days.

8. I sleep like a baby, but sometimes I have a falling sensation when I'm just going to sleep. For the most part, I sleep like a rock.
