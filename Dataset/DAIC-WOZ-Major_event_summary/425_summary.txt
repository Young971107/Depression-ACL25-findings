1. I was diagnosed twice, once back in 1972 or 1973, and then again about sixteen years ago.
2. I sought help because I felt things weren't going to change without it, and I thought medication might help me in the short term.
3. I'm not going to therapy right now because I'm looking for a place to live and don't have a job, so things are a little shaky for me.
4. I had a hard time deciding to put my cat to sleep when he was sick, and it was also difficult to give up a cat when I was moving.
5. I stopped going to therapy because I was moving around a lot, finances were tight, and I wasn't really feeling the need, but I'm starting to think it might be an option again.
6. I was in a film class at junior college, and I never returned the film we worked on, which made me feel bad because they had to redo the work.
7. I wish I was a harder worker and willing to take low-wage jobs, and I have good ideas but struggle with follow-through.
8. I would advise my younger self to go back to school, get my degree, work a regular job, and start saving for retirement.
9. I felt really happy last weekend on the beach, sitting in the sun, writing in my notebook, and feeling content.
