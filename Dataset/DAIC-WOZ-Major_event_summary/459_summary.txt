1. I went to hypnosis a few days ago, and it was really relaxing and calming. I feel like it could help me calm myself down when I'm angry and stay away from my trigger points to avoid becoming angry or depressed.

2. My mom sought help for me because she saw that I was unhappy and became worried. I stopped going to therapy on June 1st when I graduated from my drug rehab program in Utah last year. I've learned coping skills, so I'm able to manage now.

3. I argued with my mom last night about buying a ticket for a Greyhound to go to Utah.

4. I wish I could forget most of my high school years, especially my sophomore year. I didn't like high school.

5. When I was younger, my father once hit my dog in front of me because he was mad at me. That was probably the biggest thing that made me feel really badly about myself.

6. When I was sixteen, I started doing a few different drugs, and it got out of hand. My mom was trying to get me help, but I didn't want it. I kept escaping to different places and running away until I finally agreed to go to Utah to try and get sober.

7. I was diagnosed with depression for the first time when I was twelve, and I've been diagnosed multiple times since then, with the most recent diagnosis being less than a year ago.
