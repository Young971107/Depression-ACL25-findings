1. I moved out of my mom's house to have my own space and independence.
2. I recently moved to a new house with a nice backyard where I host barbecues with friends and family.
3. I helped my mom through a difficult time by supporting her financially for almost nine years.
4. I felt really happy last night because I got a new game.
5. I enjoyed my sister's birthday party with lots of dancing and seeing family I hadn't seen in a while.
6. I was thinking of pursuing a career as a sound engineer or mechanic because my dad used to do that.
7. My dad recently returned and opened a shop, and I'm considering learning mechanics from him.
