1. I tend to have outbursts when things get too chaotic at home and I feel underappreciated.
2. After an outburst, I isolate myself to relax and then return to deal with the situation calmly.
3. I started in business but got disenchanted, so I studied philosophy in college, planning to go to law school and become a professor of ethics, but ended up joining the Peace Corps instead.
4. I felt really happy when I got a new mattress and when I took the kids camping over spring break.
5. I have a fish tank at home that I use to relax myself and my children when they get upset.
6. I find it difficult to manage my anger due to my upbringing, as my mother disconnected after my father died when I was young.
7. I wish I had handled a situation differently when I had an outburst in the kitchen and banged a pot against the stove.
8. I procrastinate a lot and often start projects without finishing them, but I'm working on completing them.
9. I traveled extensively during my time in the Peace Corps in South America and also spent a year in London.
10. I've been an insomniac all my life and find it hard to sleep unless I'm physically and intellectually tired.
11. I wish I had pursued further education or career opportunities after the Peace Corps instead of resigning due to pregnancy.
12. My dream job involves writing, teaching, and traveling overseas.
13. I try to be a good mother, but I'm not a typical warm and fuzzy type; I'm more creative and do a lot of activities with my children.
