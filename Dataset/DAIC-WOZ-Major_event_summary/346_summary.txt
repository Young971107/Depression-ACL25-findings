4. I sought help initially because I wasn't sleeping and was under unbelievable stress.

10. I don't sleep well at night due to anxiety and stress from past experiences.
11. I am both an introvert and an extrovert, enjoying time alone but also meeting people.
12. Graduating from pharmacy school is one of my most memorable experiences.
