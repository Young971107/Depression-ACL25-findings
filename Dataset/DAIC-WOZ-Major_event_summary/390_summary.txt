1. I was performing in a nightclub and had an opportunity to introduce myself to a very famous person, but I didn't do it.
2. I was in another business for twenty-five years, and now I'm finally pursuing acting because the economy makes it as easy to find work in show business as in other jobs I've done.
3. My wife and I have not been sleeping in the same bed for about three years, but we have a high-achieving daughter who is graduating from high school and has been accepted to a college with a nice scholarship.
4. I was diagnosed with depression about six years ago and see a therapist, though the current therapist is not prescribing medication.
5. I made a dessert to celebrate my daughter's scholarship, and it was delicious.
6. I moved to L.A. from Minnesota thirty-one years ago, which is half my life.
7. I self-medicate to go to sleep, but often wake up earlier than I'd like to.
8. I started a business around twenty years ago, and while it was successful, I wish I had gotten it rolling more so it wouldn't be so dead today.
9. I met a woman when I first moved out here, and she left me less than healthy physically.
10. I cope pretty well, but I'm not as functional as I'd like to be, especially when I work late nights and don't get enough sleep.
11. I feel anxious due to financial responsibilities and wanting to provide for my daughter, who has wealthy friends.
12. I look forward to therapy because I feel like I'm talking to someone who understands me.
