1. I studied astronomy in school. I kind of fell into it after taking a course, liked it, and then took more courses, which led me down that path.

2. I traveled to Monterey, California, in the middle of last year, and it was very nice.

3. I argued with my ex-girlfriend about three months ago when we broke up. It wasn't a memorable argument, just a typical one between two people who had grown apart.

4. I crashed my car in high school after getting into an argument with a friend and driving too fast in an unfamiliar area.

5. I cleaned up a bunch of stuff from my room recently, which felt nice to shed some old garbage, and I felt content afterward.

6. I moved to L.A. about twenty-five years ago and haven't been back to my hometown since. I like L.A.

7. I felt really happy on Super Bowl Sunday, about a month and a half ago, when I was with all my friends having a good time.
