1. I passed my license board exam to be a nurse, which made me really happy and excited.
2. Last weekend, I went yard saleing with my family, bought a huge black bean bag for two dollars, and now it's in my room.
3. I once took some merchandise from my retail job without buying it, and I feel guilty about it.
4. I decided to pursue the medical field after getting injured as a child and being treated by doctors.
5. The hardest decision I ever made was dropping out of school because I felt I didn't belong and was in a major I didn't like.
6. I graduated two months ago, passed my board exam, and am waiting for my nursing license in the mail.
7. I went to Las Vegas with friends about a month ago, visited the Hoover Dam, and found it breathtaking.
