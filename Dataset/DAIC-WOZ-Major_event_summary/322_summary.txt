1. I made a lot of money once in Los Angeles during Christmas about ten years ago, and it made me very happy.
2. I decided to see a doctor because I was feeling down, withdrawn, and unable to focus on things I was normally interested in.
3. I used to run a business and traveled to places like Ohio and Pennsylvania to meet people and get orders, which I enjoyed.
4. I was diagnosed with depression about one to two years ago.
5. I started doing yoga and meditation about a year ago after being diagnosed with depression, as I wanted to avoid medication and was influenced by friends who practiced meditation.
6. I was among the top two percent in my MBA class and designed a successful product for my business, which made me happy.
